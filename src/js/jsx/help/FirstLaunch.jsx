                            Weâ€™re leveraging a new architecture (using HTML/CSS/JS), 
                            that enables us to add new 
                            interactions and features that will help speed 
                            up your workflows. Expect fewer clicks, 
                            dialogs, settings and controls you have to set
                            and generally get your job done faster. 
                            Stay tuned for more - this is just the beginning.
